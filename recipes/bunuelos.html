¼ cup white sugar

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Beat eggs and 1/4 cup sugar in a large bowl until thick and lemon-colored; mix in 1 teaspoon vegetable oil. Combine 1 ½ cups of flour, baking powder, and salt; gradually add to egg mixture, mixing well until evenly combined.
        </li><li>
            Turn dough out onto a floured board and knead thoroughly until dough is smooth.
        </li><li> 
            Shape dough into 16 even-sized balls. Flatten and roll each one into a very thin circle about 5 inches in diameter. Let stand uncovered on waxed paper for about 10 minutes.
        </li><li>
            Meanwhile, combine 1 cup sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl until evenly mixed; set aside. Heat oil in a deep pan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
        </li><li> 
            Lower one circle of dough carefully into the hot oil; fry until golden, turning once, about 30 seconds on each side. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain; sprinkle with cinnamon-sugar mixture. Repeat with remaining dough. Serve or cool and store in airtight containers.
